== Description ==
**This plugin is looking for maintainers!** Please [take a look at
this issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues/134).

List Category Posts allows you to list posts by category in a post/page using the [catlist] shortcode. When you're editing a page or post, directly insert the shortcode in your text and the posts will be listed there. The **basic** usage would be something like this:

`[catlist id=1]`

`[catlist name="news"]`

The shortcode accepts a category name or id, the order in which you
want the posts to display, and the number of posts to display. You can
also display the post author, date, excerpt, custom field values, even
the content!

The [catlist] shortcode can be used as many times as needed with
different arguments on each post/page. You can add a lot more
parameters according to what and how you want to show your post's
list:
`[catlist id=1 numberposts=10]`

There's an options page with only one option -for the moment-, new options will be implemented on demand.

**[Please read the instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/)** to learn which parameters are available and how to use them.

If you want to **List Categories** instead of posts you can use my other plugin **[List categories](http://wordpress.org/plugins/list-categories/)**.

You can find **Frequently Asked Questions** [here](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md#frequently-asked-questions).

**Customization**

The different elements to display con be styled with CSS. you can define an HTML tag to wrap the element with, and a CSS class for this tag. Check [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) for usage.

Great to use WordPress as a CMS, and create pages with several categories posts.

**Widget**

The plugin includes a widget which works pretty much the same as the plugin. Just add as many widgets as you want, and select all the available options from the Appearence > Widgets page.

Please, read the information on [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) and [Changelog](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/changelog/) to be aware of new functionality, and improvements to the plugin.

**Videos**

Some users have made videos on how to use the plugin, (thank you! you people are awesome!). Check them out here:

==Installation==

* Upload listcat directory into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Login to your WordPress Admin menu, go to Plugins, and activate it.
* You can find the List Category Posts widget in the Appearence > Widgets section on your WordPress Dashboard.
* If you want to customize the way the plugin displays the information, check the section on Templates on this documentation.

==INSTRUCTIONS on how to use the plugin==

==Selecting the category==
The plugin can figure out the category from which you want to list posts in several ways. **You should use only one of these methods** since these are all mutually exclusive, weird results are expected when using more than one:

* Using the *category id*.
  * **id** - To display posts from a category using the category's id. Ex: `[catlist id=24]`.
* The *category name or slug*.
  * **name** - To display posts from a category using the category's name or slug. Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory]`
* *Detecting the current post's category*. You can use the *categorypage* parameter to make it detect the category id of the current post, and list posts from that category.
  * **categorypage** - Set it to "yes" if you want to list the posts from the current post's category. `[catlist categorypage="yes"]`

When using List Category Posts whithout a category id, name or slug, it will post the latest posts from **every category**.

==Using more than one category==

* Posts from several categories with an **AND** relationship, posts that belong to all of the listed categories (note this does not show posts from any children of these categories): `[catlist id=17+25+2]` - `[catlist name=sega+nintendo]`.
* Posts from several categories with an **OR** relationship, posts that belong to any of the listed categories: `[catlist id=17,24,32]` - `[catlist name=sega,nintendo]`.
* **Exclude** a category with the minus sign (-): `[catlist id=11,-32,16]`, `[catlist id=1+2-3]`. **Important**: When using the *and* relationship, you should write the categories you want to include first, and then the ones you want to exclude. So `[catlist id=1+2-3]` will work, but `[catlist id=1+2-3+4]` won't.

==Pagination==

To use pagination, you need to set the following parameters:

* **pagination** set it to yes.

* **numberposts** - Posts per page are set with the `numberposts` parameter.

* **instance** (only necessary when using the shortcode with
    pagination more than once in the same page/post) - a number or
    name to identify the instance where you are using pagination.
    Since you can use the shortcode several times in the same page or
    post, you need to identify the instance so that you paginate only
    that instance.


Example:

`[catlist id=3 numberposts=5 pagination=yes instance=1]`

`[catlist id=5 numberposts=15 pagination=yes instance=2]`

You can customize what to show for the "next" and "previous" buttons
in the pagination navigation. Use the following params:

 * **pagination_prev** - Replace the "<<" characters in the "previous"
 button in the pagination navigation with a custom text.
 * **pagination_next** - Replace the ">>" characters in the "next"
 button in the pagination navigation with a custom text.

==Changing the pagination CSS==

If you want to customize the way the pagination is displayed, you can
copy the `lcp_paginator.css` file from the plugin's directory to your
theme's directory and customize it. Do not customize the file on the
plugin's directory since this file will be overwritten every time you
update the plugin.

==Other parameters==

* **author_posts** - Get posts by author. Use 'user_nicename' (NOT
    name). Example: `[catlist author_posts="fernando"]`

* **tags** - Tag support, display posts from a certain tag.

* **currenttags** - Display posts from the current post's tags (won't
    work on pages since they have no tags).

* **exclude_tags** - Exclude posts from one or more tags: `[catlist tags="videogames" exclude_tags="sega,sony"]`

* **orderby** - To customize the order. Valid values are:
  * **author** - Sort by the numeric author IDs.
  * **category** - Sort by the numeric category IDs.
  * **content** - Sort by content.
  * **date** - Sort by creation date.
  * **ID** - Sort by numeric post ID.
  * **menu_order** - Sort by the menu order. Only useful with pages.
  * **mime_type** - Sort by MIME type. Only useful with attachments.
  * **modified** - Sort by last modified date.
  * **name** - Sort by stub.
  * **parent** - Sort by parent ID.
  * **password** - Sort by password.
  * **rand** - Randomly sort results.
  * **status** - Sort by status.
  * **title** - Sort by title.
  * **type** - Sort by type. Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory orderby=date]`

* **customfield_orderby** - You can order the posts by a custom field. For example: `[catlist numberposts=-1 customfield_orderby=Mood order=desc]` will list all the posts with a "Mood" custom field. Remember the default order is descending, more on order:

* **order** - How to sort **orderby**. Valid values are:
  * **ASC** - Ascending (lowest to highest).
  * **DESC** - Descending (highest to lowest). Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory orderby=title order=asc]`

* **starting_with** - Get posts whose title starts with a certain
    letter. Example: `[catlist starting_with="l"]` will list all posts
    whose title starts with L. You can use several letters: `[catlist starting_with="m,o,t"]`.

* **numberposts** - Number of posts to return. Set to 0 to use the max
    number of posts per page. Set to -1 to remove the limit.
    Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory numberposts=10]`
    You can set the default number of posts globally on the options
    page on your Dashboard in Settings / List Category Posts.

* **no_posts_text** - Text to display when no posts are found. If you
    don't specify it, nothing will get displayed where the posts
    should be.

* **monthnum** and **year** - List posts from a certain year or month. You can use these together or independently. Example: `[catlist year=2015]` will list posts from the year 2015. `[catlist monthnum=8]` will list posts published in August of every year. `[catlist year=2012 monthnum=12]` will list posts from December 2012.

* **search** - List posts that match a search term. `[catlist search="The Cake is a lie"]`

* **date** - Display post's date next to the title. Default is 'no',
    use date=yes to activate it. You can set a css class and an html
    tag to wrap the date in with `date_class` and `date_tag` (see HTML
    & CSS Customization further below).

* **date_modified** - Display the date a post was last modified next
    to the title. You can set a css class and an html tag to wrap the
    date in with `date_modified_class` and `date_modified_tag` (see
    HTML & CSS Customization further below).

* **author** - Display the post's author next to the title. Default is
    'no', use author=yes to activate it. You can set a css class and an html
    tag to wrap the author name in with `author_class` and `author_tag` (see HTML
    & CSS Customization further below).

    When displaying the post author, you can also display a link to the
    author's page. The following parameter **only works if author=yes
    is present in the shortcode**:

    * **author_posts_link** - Gets the URL of the author page for the
      author. The HTML and CSS customization are the ones applied to `author`.

* **dateformat** - Format of the date output. The default format is the one you've set on your WordPress settings. Example: `[catlist id=42 dateformat="l F dS, Y"]` would display the date as "Monday January 21st, 2013". Check http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time for more options to display date.

* **excerpt** - Display the post's excerpt. Default is 'no', use `excerpt=yes` to activate it. If you don't have an excerpt in your post, the plugin will fetch this text from the content, striping its images, shortcodes and HTML tags. The limit is set by the *excerpt_size* parameter (55 words by default). If you want the automatically generated excerpt to respect your theme's allowed HTML tags, you should use `excerpt_strip=no`. If the post has an excerpt, the HTML tags are automatically stripped. If you want to overwrite the post's excerpt with an automatically generated one (may be usefull to allow HTML tags), use `excerpt_overwrite=yes`. I added this last parameter to have consistency across excerpts.

* **excerpt_size** - Set the number of *words* to display from the excerpt. Default is 55. Eg: `excerpt_size=30`

* **excerpt_strip** - Set it to `yes` to strip the excerpt's HTML tags. If the excerpt is auto generated by the plugin, the HTML tags will be stripped, and you should use `excerpt_strip=no` to see the excerpt with HTML formatting.

* **title_limit** - Set the limit of characters for the title. Ex:
    `[catlist id=2 title_limit=50]` will show only the first 50
    characters of the title and add "…" at the end.

* **excludeposts** - IDs of posts to exclude from the list. Use 'this' to exclude the current post. Ex: `[catlist excludeposts=this,12,52,37]`

* **offset** - You can displace or pass over one or more initial posts which would normally be collected by your query through the use of the offset parameter.

* **content** - **WARNING**: If you want to show the content on your listed posts, you might want to do this from a new [Page Template](http://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates) or a [Custom Post Type](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Type_Templates) template. Using this parameter is discouraged, you can have memory issues as well as infinite loop situations when you're displaying a post that's using List Category Posts. You have been warned. Usage:

Show the excerpt or full content of the post. If there's a &lt;!--more--&gt; tag in the post, then it will behave just as WordPress does: only show the content previous to the more tag. Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist content=yes]`

Show the full content of the post regardless of whether there is a &lt;!--more--&gt; tag in the post. Ex: `[catlist content=full]`

* **catlink** - Show the title of the category with a link to the category. Use the **catlink_string** option to change the link text. Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist catlink=yes]`. The way it's programmed, it should only display the title for the first category you chose, and include the posts from all of the categories. I thought of this parameter mostly for using several shortcodes on one page or post, so that each group of posts would have the title of that group's category. If you need to display several titles with posts, you should use one [catlist] shortcode for each category you want to display.

* **catname** - Show the title of the category (or categories), works exactly as `catlink`, but it doesn't add a link to the category.

* **category_count** -  Shows the posts count in that category, only works when using the **catlink** option: `[catlist name=nintendo catlink=yes category_count=yes]`

* **comments** - Show comments count for each post. Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist comments=yes]`.

* **thumbnail** - Show post thumbnail (http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/new-in-wordpress-2-9-post-thumbnail-images/). Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist thumbnail=yes]`.

* **thumbnail_size** - Either a string keyword (thumbnail, medium, large or full) or 2 values representing width and height in pixels. Ex: `[catlist thumbnail_size=32,32]` or `[catlist thumbnail_size=thumbnail]`

* **thumbnail_class** - Set a CSS class for the thumbnail.

* **post_type** - The type of post to show. Available options are: post - Default, page, attachment, any - all post types. You can use several types, example: `[catlist post_type="page,post" numberposts=-1]`

* **post_status** - use post status, default value is 'publish'. Valid values:
  * **publish** - a published post or page.
  * **pending** - post is pending review.
  * **draft** - a post in draft status.
  * **auto-draft** - a newly created post, with no content.
  * **future** - a post to publish in the future.
  * **private** - not visible to users who are not logged in.
  * **inherit** - a revision. see get_children.
  * **trash** - post is in trashbin (available with Version 2.9).
  * **any** - retrieves any status except those from post types with 'exclude_from_search' set to true.
  You can use several post statuses. Example: `[catlist post_status="future, publish" excludeposts=this]`

* **show_protected** - Show posts protected by password. By default
    they are not displayed. Use: `[catlist show_protected=yes]`

* **post_parent** - Show only the children of the post with this ID.
    Default: None.

* **post_suffix** - Pass a String to this parameter to display this
    String after every post title.
    Ex: `[catlist numberposts=-1
    post_suffix="Hello World"]` will create something like:

    ```<ul class="lcp_catlist" id=lcp_instance_0>
       <li>
         <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/?p=42" title="WordPress">
           WordPress
         </a> Hello World </li>```

* **display_id** - Set it to yes to show the Post's ID next to the post title: `[catlist id=3 display_id=yes]`

* **class** - CSS class for the default UL generated by the plugin.

* **custom fields** - To use custom fields, you must specify two values: customfield_name and customfield_value. Using this only show posts that contain a custom field with this name and value. Both parameters must be defined, or neither will work.

* **customfield_display** - Display custom field(s). You can specify
    many fields to show, separating them with a coma. If you want to
    display just the value and not the name of the custom field, use
    `customfield_display_name` and set it to no.
    By default, the custom fields will show inside a div with a
    specific class: `<div class="lcp-customfield">`. You can customize
    this using the customfield_tag and customfield_class parameters to
    set a different tag (instead of the div) and a specific class
    (instead of lcp-customfield).

* **customfield_display_name** - To use with `customfield_display`.
    Use it to just print the value of the Custom field and not the
    name. Example:
`[catlist numberposts=-1 customfield_display="Mood"
   customfield_display_name="no"]`
Will print the value of the Custom Field "Mood" but not the text
    "Mood: [value]".

* **template** - By default, posts will be listed in an unordered list
    (ul tag) with the class 'lcp_catlist':

    `<ul class="lcp_catlist"><li><a href="post1">Post 1</li>...`

    You can use a different class by using the *class* parameter.

    You can create your own template file (Check **Template System**
    further down this document) and pass it as a parameter here. The
    parameter is the template name without the extension. For example
    for `mytemplate.php`, the value would be `mytemplate`.

    You can also pass these two parameters which yield different
    results:
      * `div` - This will output a div with the `lcp_catlist` class
    (or one you pass as a parameter with the `class` argument). The
    posts will be displayed between p tags.

      * `ol` - This will output an ordered list with the `lcp_catlist`
      css class (or the one you pass as a parameter with the `class`
      argument) and each post will be a list item inside the ordered list.

* **morelink** - Include a "more" link to access the category archive for the category. The link is inserted after listing the posts. It receives a string of characters as a parameter which will be used as the text of the link. Example: `[catlist id=38 morelink="Read more"]`

* **posts_morelink** - Include a "read more" link after each post. It receives a string of characters as a parameter which will be used as the text of the link. Example: `[catlist id=38 posts_morelink="Read more about this post"]`

* **link_target** - Select the `target` attribute for links to posts (target=_blank, _self, _parent, _top, *framename*). Example: `[catlink id=3 link_target=_blank]` will create: `<a href="http://localhost/wordpress/?p=45" title="Test post" target="_blank">Test post</a>`

* **no_post_titles** - If set to `yes`, no post titles will be shown. This may make sense together with `content=yes`.

== Widget ==

The widget is quite simple, and it doesn't implement all of the plugin's functionality. To use a shortcode in a widget add this code to your theme's functions.php file:

`add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');`

Then just add a new text widget to your blog and use the shortcode there as the widget's content.

== HTML & CSS Customization ==

By default, the plugin lists the posts in an unordered list with the
`lcp_catlist` CSS class, like this:

`<ul class="lcp_catlist">`

So if you want to customize the appearance of the List Category Posts
lists, you can just edit the lcp_catlist class in your theme's CSS.

You can also customize what HTML tags different elements will be
surrounded with, and set a CSS class for this element, or just a CSS class
which will wrap the element with a `span` tag.

The customizable elements (so far) are: author, catlink (category link), comments, date, excerpt, morelink ("Read More" link), thumbnail and title (post title).

The parameters are:
`autor_tag, author_class, catlink_tag, catlink_class, comments_tag,
comments_class, date_tag, date_class, date_modified_tag,
date_modified_class, excerpt_tag, excerpt_class, morelink_class,
thumbnail_class, title_tag, title_class, posts_morelink_class,
customfield_tag, customfield_class`

So let's say you want to wrap the displayed comments count with the p tag and a "lcp_comments" class, you would do:
`[catlist id=7 comments=yes comments_tag=p comments_class=lcp_comments]`
This would produce the following code:
`<p class="lcp_comments"> (3)</p>`

Or you just want to style the displayed date, you could wrap it with a span tag:
`[catlist name=blog date=yes date_tag=span date_class=lcp_date]`
This would produce the following code:
`<span class="lcp_date">March 21, 2011</span>`

Elements without a specified tag, but a specified class, will be wrapped with a span tag and its class. For example this:
`[catlist id=7  date=yes date_class="lcp_date"]`
Will produce the following:
`<span class="lcp_date">October 23, 2013</span>`

The only exceptions here are the **title_tag** and **title_class**
parameters. If you only use the **title_class** parameter, the CSS
class will be assigned to the `a` tag like this:
`[catlist id=1 title_class="lcp_title"]`
Will produce:
`<a href="http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/?p=38" title="Test" class="lcp_title">Test</a>`
But if you use both:
`[catlist numberposts=5 title_class=lcp_title tag=h4]`
You will get:
`<h4 class="lcp_title">
    <a title="Hipchat" href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/?p=40"></a>
</h4>`

== Template System ==

Templates for the List Category Plugin are searched for in your WordPress theme's folder. You should create a folder named list-category-posts under 'wp-content/themes/your-theme-folder'. Template files are .php files.

You can use the included template as an example to start. It's in the plugin's template folder under the name default.php. To use a template, use this code:
`[catlist id=1 template=templatename]`
If the template file were templatename.php.

You can have as many different templates as you want, and use them in different pages and posts. The template code is pretty well documented, so if you're a bit familiar with HTML and PHP, you'll have no problems creating your own template. I'm planning on reworking the template system in order to have a really user friendly way to create templates.

You can find the Frequently Asked Questions [here](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md#frequently-asked-questions).


== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.37 =

When using `content=yes`, if the post has a more tag, the plugin will only show the content previous to the more tag and not all the content as it used before (it now supports the more tag the same way as WordPress).

= 0.34 =
 * Now the plugin accepts either class or tag or both for styling elements (such as date, author, etc. to display). When just using a tag, it will sorround the element with that tag. When using just a class, it will sorround the element between span tags and the given CSS class. Check [Other notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) under **HTML & CSS Customization** for more info.
 * Fixed bug on `post_status`, it used to show all published posts and if user was logged in, all private ones too. Now you can specify 'private' to just display private posts, and draft, publish, draft, etc (See **post_status** param on the [instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) for more info).

= 0.25 =
* Translation support.

= 0.18 =
Template system was upgraded with new options. Backwards compatible, but you can better customize the way the post contents are displayed. Check templates/default.php.

= 0.17 =
Upgrade your templates: Templates system was rewritten, so your current templates will probably not work. Check out the new default.php file on /templates to see the simpler new way to work with templates.

= 0.13.2 =
Thumbnail parameter 'thumbnails' changed to 'thumbnail.

= 0.7.2 =
Template system has changed. Now the posts loop must be defined inside the template. Check templates/default.php for an example.

= 0.8 =
Widget built for WordPress 2.8's Widget API, so you need at least WP 2.8 to use the widget.

= 0.9 =
Template system has changed. Custom templates should be stored in WordPress theme folder.
