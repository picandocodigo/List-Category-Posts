List Category Posts allows you to list posts by category and many other parameters in a post, page or widget. You use the [catlist] shortcode to select which posts to show and how. There's tons of customizations available.

== Description ==

List Category Posts allows you to list posts by category in a post or page using the `[catlist]` shortcode. When you're editing a page or post, directly insert the shortcode in your text and the posts will be listed there. The *basic* usage would be something like this:

`[catlist id=1]`

`[catlist name="news"]`

The shortcode accepts a category name or id, the order in which you want the posts to display, and the number of posts to display. You can also display the post author, date, excerpt, custom field values, even the content! A lot of parameters have been added to customize what to display and how to show it. Check [the full documentation](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) to learn about the different ways to use it.

The `[catlist]` shortcode can be used as many times as needed with different arguments on each post/page.
`[catlist id=1 numberposts=10]`

There's an options page with only one option -for the moment-, new options will be implemented on demand (as long as they make sense). Right now the only global option is the `numberposts` parameter, to define a default number of posts to show for each instance (you can override this value by using the `numberposts` parameter in your shortcode).

**[Read the instructions](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki)** to learn which parameters are available and how to use them.

If you want to **List Categories** instead of posts you can use my other plugin **[List categories](http://wordpress.org/plugins/list-categories/)**.

You can find **Frequently Asked Questions** [here](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md#frequently-asked-questions).

**Customization**

The different elements to display can be styled with CSS. you can define an HTML tag to wrap the element with, and a CSS class for this tag. Check [the documentation](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) for usage. You can also check [this nice tutorial](http://sundari-webdesign.com/wordpress-the-quest-to-my-perfect-list-view-for-posts-events-and-articles/) which gives lots of tips and how-to's to customize how to display the posts.

Great to use WordPress as a CMS, and create pages with several categories posts.

**Widget**

Since WordPress 4.9, [you can use shortcode in text widgets](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/). So you can just add a text widget in Appearence > Widgets and write the List Category Posts shortcode.

The plugin also includes a widget as a simple interface for its functionality. Just add as many widgets as you want, and select all the available options from the Appearence > Widgets page. Not all the functionality in the shortcode has been implemented in the widget yet. You can use the shortcode for the most flexibility.

Please, read the information on [the wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) and [Changelog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/list-category-posts/#developers) to be aware of new functionality, and improvements to the plugin.

**Videos**

Some users have made videos on how to use the plugin (thank you, you are awesome!), check them out here:

 * [Manage WordPress Content with List Category Posts Plugin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBy_qoGKpdo)
 * [WordPress: How to List Category Posts on a Page](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfnzk4IWPNA)

**Support the plugin**

If you've found the plugin useful, consider making a [donation via PayPal](http://picandocodigo.net/programacion/wordpress/list-category-posts-wordpress-plugin-english/#support "Donate via PayPal").

**Development**

Development is being tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts). Fork it, code, make a pull request, suggest improvements, etc. over there. I dream of the day all of the WordPress plugins will be hosted on Git :)

Since the documentation on how to use the plugin has passed wordpress.org's character limit, the text was cut. I've since started using [a wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) for more comfortable reading and maintaining. Please check it out, suggestions are welcome on GitHub issues!

==Instructions on how to use the plugin==

==SELECTING THE CATEGORY==
The plugin can figure out the category from which you want to list posts in several ways. **You should use only one of these methods** since these are all mutually exclusive, weird results are expected when using more than one:

* Using the *category id*.
  * **id** - To display posts from a category using the category's id. Ex: `[catlist id=24]`.
* The *category name or slug*.
  * **name** - To display posts from a category using the category's name or slug. Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory]`
* *Detecting the current post's category*. You can use the *categorypage* parameter to make it detect the category id of the current post, and list posts from that category.
  * **categorypage** - Set it to "yes" if you want to list the posts from the current post's category. `[catlist categorypage="yes"]`

When using List Category Posts whithout a category id, name or slug, it will post the latest posts from **every category**.

==USING MORE THAN ONE CATEGORY==

* Posts from several categories with an **AND** relationship, posts that belong to all of the listed categories (note this does not show posts from any children of these categories): `[catlist id=17+25+2]` - `[catlist name=sega+nintendo]`.
* Posts from several categories with an **OR** relationship, posts that belong to any of the listed categories: `[catlist id=17,24,32]` - `[catlist name=sega,nintendo]`.
* **Exclude** a category with the minus sign (-): `[catlist id=11,-32,16]`, `[catlist id=1+2-3]`. **Important**: When using the *and* relationship, you should write the categories you want to include first, and then the ones you want to exclude. So `[catlist id=1+2-3]` will work, but `[catlist id=1+2-3+4]` won't.

==Other ways of selecting what posts to show==

* **child_categories** - Exclude/include posts from the child categories. By default they are included. If you have a "Parent Category" and you use: `[catlist name="Parent Category"]`, you'll see posts from it's child categories as if they were posts from the same category. You can use this parameter to exclude these posts: `[catlist name="Parent Category" child_categories=false]`.

* **author_posts** - Get posts by author. Use 'user_nicename' (NOT
    name). Example: `[catlist author_posts="fernando"]`

* **tags** - Tag support, display posts from a certain tag. You can use an "OR" relationship `[catlist tags="nintendo,sega"]` or "AND" relationship (posts that belong to all of the listed tags): `[catilst tags="nintendo+sega"]`.

* **taxonomy** - You can select posts using custom taxonomies. There's two ways of selecting taxonomies:
    * You need to set the taxonomy and the terms: `[catlist taxonomy='person' terms='bob']`. It supports both the "IN" and "AND" logical relationships between each inner taxonomy. For the `AND` relationship, separate terms with a plus sign: ` [catlist taxonomy='topic' terms='topic1+topic2']`. For the `OR` relationship, separate terms with a comma: `[catlist taxonomy='topic' terms='topic1,topic2']`.
    * Multiple taxonomies: You can use multiple taxonomy terms in one shortcode like this:
      * OR - `taxonomies_or="tax1:{term1_1,term1_2};tax2:{term2_1,term2_2,term2_3}"`
      * AND - `taxonomies_and="tax1:{term1_1,term1_2};tax2:{term2_1,term2_2,term2_3}"`


* **currenttags** - Display posts from the current post's tags (won't
    work on pages since they have no tags). Pass it the 'yes' string for it to work: `[catlist currenttags="yes"]`. `OR` is the default relationship, use `currenttags="all"` for the `AND` relationship.

* **exclude_tags** - Exclude posts from one or more tags: `[catlist tags="videogames" exclude_tags="sega,sony"]`

* **starting_with** - Get posts whose title starts with a certain
    letter. Example: `[catlist starting_with="l"]` will list all posts
    whose title starts with L. You can use several letters: `[catlist starting_with="m,o,t"]`.

* **monthnum** and **year** - List posts from a certain year or month. You can use these together or independently. Example: `[catlist year=2015]` will list posts from the year 2015. `[catlist monthnum=8]` will list posts published in August of every year. `[catlist year=2012 monthnum=12]` will list posts from December 2012.

* **date ranges** - You can also use date ranges for listing posts. For example "list every post after March 14th, 2005". The parameters are: ```after, after_year, after_month, after_day, before, before_year, before_month,  before_day```. You can use `today` as a value, the plugin will get today's date dynamically and display only old posts. These parameters are used to specify data_query arguments (see: [the codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Date_Parameters)).

     If you want to list all the posts before a given date, say `Jun 17th, 2007` you can use these two options:
     `[catlist before_year=2007 before_month=06 before_day=17]`
     Or you can use the `before` parameter with a [strtotime()-compatible string](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php):
     `[catlist before='2007/06/17']`

     The same works for posts after a given date, you can use:
     `[catlist after_year=2007 after_month=06 after_day=17]`
     Or just `after` with a [strtotime()-compatible string](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php):
     `[catlist after='2007/06/17']`

    `after` takes priority over `after_year`, `after_month`, and `after_day`.
    `before` takes priority over `before_year`, `before_month`, and `before_day`.

* **search** - List posts that match a search term. `[catlist search="The Cake is a lie"]`

* **excludeposts** - IDs of posts to exclude from the list. Use 'this' to exclude the current post. Ex: `[catlist excludeposts=this,12,52,37]`

* **offset** - You can displace or pass over one or more initial posts which would normally be collected by your query through the use of the offset parameter.

* **post_type** - The type of post to show. Available options are: post - Default, page, attachment, any - all post types. You can use several types, example: `[catlist post_type="page,post" numberposts=-1]`

* **post_status** - use post status, default value is 'publish'. Valid values:
  * **publish** - a published post or page.
  * **pending** - post is pending review.
  * **draft** - a post in draft status.
  * **auto-draft** - a newly created post, with no content.
  * **future** - a post to publish in the future.
  * **private** - not visible to users who are not logged in.
  * **inherit** - a revision. see get_children.
  * **trash** - post is in trashbin (available with Version 2.9).
  * **any** - retrieves any status except those from post types with 'exclude_from_search' set to true.
  You can use several post statuses. Example: `[catlist post_status="future, publish" excludeposts=this]`

* **show_protected** - Show posts protected by password. By default
    they are not displayed. Use: `[catlist show_protected=yes]`

* **post_parent** - Show only the children of the post with this ID.
    Default: None.

* **custom fields** - To use custom fields, you must specify two values: customfield_name and customfield_value. `customfield_name` defines the name of the field, and you should choose the values for which you want posts to display. Using this only show posts that contain a custom field with this name and value. Both parameters must be defined, or neither will work. Eg: `[catlist customfield_name="color" customfield_value="green"]` will display posts with the value `green` set on the custom field `color`. This parameter can be used together with `customfield_orderby`, see further below for more information.

==PAGINATION

See the wiki: [Pagination](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Pagination).

==OTHER PARAMETERS==

* **conditional_title** - Display a custom title before the posts list.
    The title is not displayed if the list is empty. Set to the empty string
    (default value) to disable.
    Example: `[catlist conditional_title="Other posts"]`.

* **conditional_title_tag** - Specify the tag used for the conditional title.
    Defaults to 'h3'.

* **conditional_title_class** - Specify the class used for the conditional
    title. Defaults to the empty string (no special class).

* **orderby** - To customize the order. Valid values are:
  * **author** - Sort by the numeric author IDs.
  * **category** - Sort by the numeric category IDs.
  * **content** - Sort by content.
  * **date** - Sort by creation date.
  * **ID** - Sort by numeric post ID.
  * **menu_order** - Sort by the menu order. Only useful with pages.
  * **mime_type** - Sort by MIME type. Only useful with attachments.
  * **modified** - Sort by last modified date.
  * **name** - Sort by stub.
  * **parent** - Sort by parent ID.
  * **password** - Sort by password.
  * **rand** - Randomly sort results.
  * **status** - Sort by status.
  * **title** - Sort by title.
  * **type** - Sort by type. Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory orderby=date]`

* **customfield_orderby** - You can order the posts by a custom field. For example: `[catlist numberposts=-1 customfield_orderby=Mood order=desc]` will list all the posts with a "Mood" custom field. This parameter can be used toghether with `customfield_name` and `customfield_value`, you can use those parameters to select posts and then `customfield_orderby` to sort by this or another custom field.  Remember the default order is descending, more on order:

* **order** - How to sort **orderby**. Valid values are:
  * **ASC** - Ascending (lowest to highest).
  * **DESC** - Descending (highest to lowest). Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory orderby=title order=asc]`

* **numberposts** - Number of posts to return. Set to 0 to use the max
    number of posts per page. Set to -1 to remove the limit.
    Ex: `[catlist name=mycategory numberposts=10]`
    You can set the default number of posts globally on the options
    page on your Dashboard in Settings / List Category Posts.

* **no_posts_text** - Text to display when no posts are found. If you
    don't specify it, nothing will get displayed where the posts
    should be.

* **date** - Display post's date next to the title. Default is 'no',
    use date=yes to activate it. You can set a css class and an html
    tag to wrap the date in with `date_class` and `date_tag` (see HTML
    & CSS Customization further below).

* **date_modified** - Display the date a post was last modified next
    to the title. You can set a css class and an html tag to wrap the
    date in with `date_modified_class` and `date_modified_tag` (see
    HTML & CSS Customization further below).

* **author** - Display the post's author next to the title. Default is
    'no', use author=yes to activate it. You can set a css class and an html
    tag to wrap the author name in with `author_class` and `author_tag` (see HTML
    & CSS Customization further below).

    When displaying the post author, you can also display a link to the
    author's page. The following parameter **only works if author=yes
    is present in the shortcode**:

    * **author_posts_link** - Gets the URL of the author page for the
      author. The HTML and CSS customization are the ones applied to `author`.

* **dateformat** - Format of the date output. The default format is the one you've set on your WordPress settings. Example: `[catlist id=42 dateformat="l F dS, Y"]` would display the date as "Monday January 21st, 2013". Check http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time for more options to display date.

* **excerpt** - Display a plain text excerpt of the post. Default is 'no', use `excerpt=yes` or `excerpt=full` to activate it. If you have a separate excerpt in your post, this text will be used. If you don't have an explicit excerpt in your post, the plugin will generate one from the content, striping its images, shortcodes and HTML tags. If you want to overwrite the post's separate excerpt with an automatically generated one (may be useful to allow HTML tags), use `excerpt_overwrite=yes`.

  If you use `excerpt=yes`, the separate excerpt or content will be limited to the number of words set by the *excerpt_size* parameter (55 words by default).

  If you use `excerpt=full` the plugin will act more like Wordpress. If the post has a separate excerpt, it will be used in full. Otherwise if the content has a &lt;!--more--&gt; tag then the excerpt will be the text before this tag, and if there is no &lt;!--more--&gt; tag then the result will be the same as `excerpt=yes`.

  If you want the automatically generated excerpt to respect your theme's allowed HTML tags, you should use `excerpt_strip=no`, otherwise the HTML tags are automatically stripped.

* **excerpt_size** - Set the number of *words* to display from the excerpt. Default is 55. Eg: `excerpt_size=30`

* **excerpt_strip** - Set it to `yes` to strip the excerpt's HTML tags. If the excerpt is auto generated by the plugin, the HTML tags will be stripped, and you should use `excerpt_strip=no` to see the excerpt with HTML formatting.

* **title_limit** - Set the limit of characters for the title. Ex:
    `[catlist id=2 title_limit=50]` will show only the first 50
    characters of the title and add "…" at the end.

* **content** - **WARNING**: If you want to show the content on your listed posts, you might want to do this from a new [Page Template](http://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates) or a [Custom Post Type](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Type_Templates) template. Using this parameter is discouraged, you can have memory issues as well as infinite loop situations when you're displaying a post that's using List Category Posts. You have been warned. Usage:

    * `yes` - Show the excerpt or full content of the post. If there's a &lt;!--more--&gt; tag in the post, then it will behave just as WordPress does: only show the content previous to the more tag. Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist content=yes]`

    * `full` - Show the full content of the post regardless of whether there is a &lt;!--more--&gt; tag in the post. Ex: `[catlist content=full]`

* **catlink** - Show the title of the category with a link to the category. Use the **catlink_string** option to change the link text. Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist catlink=yes]`. The way it's programmed, it should only display the title for the first category you chose, and include the posts from all of the categories. I thought of this parameter mostly for using several shortcodes on one page or post, so that each group of posts would have the title of that group's category. If you need to display several titles with posts, you should use one [catlist] shortcode for each category you want to display.

* **category_description** Show the category description wrapped in a p tag: `[catlist id=1 category_description='yes']`

* **catname** - Show the title of the category (or categories), works exactly as `catlink`, but it doesn't add a link to the category.

* **category_count** -  Shows the posts count in that category, only works when using the **catlink** option: `[catlist name=nintendo catlink=yes category_count=yes]`

* **comments** - Show comments count for each post. Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist comments=yes]`.

* **thumbnail** - Show post thumbnail (http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/new-in-wordpress-2-9-post-thumbnail-images/). Default is 'no'. Ex: `[catlist thumbnail=yes]`.

* **force_thumbnail** - If the previous parameter is set to 'yes', and there's no featured image, setting this to 'yes' or 'true' will make the plugin look for the first image in the post and use it as a thumbnail. Ex: `[catlist thumbnail=yes force_thumbnail=yes]`.

* **thumbnail_size** - Either a string keyword (thumbnail, medium, large or full) or 2 values representing width and height in pixels. Ex: `[catlist thumbnail_size=32,32]` or `[catlist thumbnail_size=thumbnail]`

* **thumbnail_class** - Set a CSS class for the thumbnail.

* **post_suffix** - Pass a String to this parameter to display this
    String after every post title.
    Ex: `[catlist numberposts=-1
    post_suffix="Hello World"]` will create something like:

    `<ul class="lcp_catlist" id=lcp_instance_0>`
    `   <li>`
    `     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/?p=42" title="WordPress">`
    `       WordPress`
    `     </a> Hello World </li>`

* **display_id** - Set it to yes to show the Post's ID next to the post title: `[catlist id=3 display_id=yes]`

* **class** - CSS class for the default UL generated by the plugin.

* **tags_as_class** - Use a post's tags as a class for the `li` that lists the posts. Default is `no`. For example, `[catlist tags_as_class=yes]` will show a post that has the `fun` tag like this:
```
<li class=" fun ">
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/?p=1267" title="Post Title">Post Title</a>
</li>
```

* **customfield_display** - Display custom field(s). You can specify
    many fields to show, separating them with a coma. If you want to
    display just the value and not the name of the custom field, use
    `customfield_display_name` and set it to no.
    By default, the custom fields will show inside a div with a
    specific class: `<div class="lcp-customfield">`. You can customize
    this using the customfield_tag and customfield_class parameters to
    set a different tag (instead of the div) and a specific class
    (instead of lcp-customfield).

* **customfield_display_glue** - Specify the text to appear between two custom
    fields if displayed together, defaults to the empty string. Not used if
    the `customfield_display_separately` parameter is defined.

* **customfield_display_separately** - Display the custom fields separately.
    Each custom field is displayd within its own tag (see `customfield_tag`).
    Defaults to 'no', set to 'yes' to enable. Superseeds the
    `customfield_display_glue` parameter when enabled.

* **customfield_display_name** - To use with `customfield_display`.
    Use it to just print the value of the Custom field and not the
    name. Example:
`[catlist numberposts=-1 customfield_display="Mood"
   customfield_display_name="no"]`
Will print the value of the Custom Field "Mood" but not the text
    "Mood: [value]".

* **customfield_display_name_glue** - To use with `customfield_display_name`.
    Use it to specify the text between the name and the value, defaults to
    ' : '.

* **template** - By default, posts will be listed in an unordered list
    (ul tag) with the class 'lcp_catlist':

    `<ul class="lcp_catlist"><li><a href="post1">Post 1</a></li>...`

    You can use a different class by using the *class* parameter.

    You can create your own template file (Check **Template System**
    further down this document) and pass it as a parameter here. The
    parameter is the template name without the extension. For example
    for `mytemplate.php`, the value would be `mytemplate`.

    You can also pass these two parameters which yield different
    results:
      * `div` - This will output a div with the `lcp_catlist` class
    (or one you pass as a parameter with the `class` argument). The
    posts will be displayed between p tags. `[catlist template=div]`

      * `ol` - This will output an ordered list with the `lcp_catlist`
      css class (or the one you pass as a parameter with the `class`
      argument) and each post will be a list item inside the ordered list. `[catlist template=ol]`.

* **morelink** - Include a "more" link to access the category archive for the category. The link is inserted after listing the posts. It receives a string of characters as a parameter which will be used as the text of the link. Example: `[catlist id=38 morelink="Read more"]`

* **posts_morelink** - Include a "read more" link after each post. It receives a string of characters as a parameter which will be used as the text of the link. Example: `[catlist id=38 posts_morelink="Read more about this post"]`

* **link_target** - Select the `target` attribute for links to posts (target=_blank, _self, _parent, _top, *framename*). Example: `[catlink id=3 link_target=_blank]` will create: `<a href="http://localhost/wordpress/?p=45" title="Test post" target="_blank">Test post</a>`

* **no_post_titles** - If set to `yes`, no post titles will be shown. This may make sense together with `content=yes`.

* **link_titles** - Option to display titles without links. If set to `false`, the post titles won't be linking to the article.

* **link_dates** - Option to wrap dates with a link to the post. Set to `true` or `yes` to enable, set to `false` or `no` to disable. Defaults to `false`.


==Installation==

* Upload the `list-category-posts` directory to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Login to your WordPress Admin menu, go to Plugins, and activate it.
* Start using the '[catlist]` shortcode in your posts and/or pages.
* You can find the List Category Posts widget in the Appearence > Widgets section on your WordPress Dashboard.
* If you want to customize the way the plugin displays the information, check [HTML & CSS Customization](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/HTML-&-CSS-Customization) or the [section on Templates](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Template-System) on the wiki.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

You can find the Frequently Asked Questions [here](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md#frequently-asked-questions).

**INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE PLUGIN**

Check out [the Wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/)

Please read the instructions and the FAQ before opening a new topic in the support forums.

**Widget**

The widget is quite simple, and it doesn't implement all of the plugin's functionality.

Since WordPress 4.9, you can use a shortcode in a widget. If you're using a previous WordPress version, add this code to your theme's functions.php file:

`add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');`

Then just add a new text widget to your blog and use the shortcode there as the widget's content.

**HTML & CSS Customization**

**TEMPLATE SYSTEM**

How to customize the way the posts are shown: [Template System](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Template-System). I am aware the Template System is not the friendliest right now, I'll work on improving this if I ever get the time to work on it.

= 0.37 =

When using `content=yes`, if the post has a more tag, the plugin will only show the content previous to the more tag and not all the content as it used before (it now supports the more tag the same way as WordPress).

= 0.34 =
 * Now the plugin accepts either class or tag or both for styling elements (such as date, author, etc. to display). When just using a tag, it will sorround the element with that tag. When using just a class, it will sorround the element between span tags and the given CSS class. Check [Other notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) under **HTML & CSS Customization** for more info.
 * Fixed bug on `post_status`, it used to show all published posts and if user was logged in, all private ones too. Now you can specify 'private' to just display private posts, and draft, publish, draft, etc (See **post_status** param on the [instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) for more info).

= 0.25 =
* Translation support.

= 0.18 =
Template system was upgraded with new options. Backwards compatible, but you can better customize the way the post contents are displayed. Check templates/default.php.

= 0.17 =
Upgrade your templates: Templates system was rewritten, so your current templates will probably not work. Check out the new default.php file on /templates to see the simpler new way to work with templates.

= 0.13.2 =
Thumbnail parameter 'thumbnails' changed to 'thumbnail.

= 0.7.2 =
Template system has changed. Now the posts loop must be defined inside the template. Check templates/default.php for an example.

= 0.8 =
Widget built for WordPress 2.8's Widget API, so you need at least WP 2.8 to use the widget.

= 0.9 =
Template system has changed. Custom templates should be stored in WordPress theme folder.

== Changelog ==

= 0.79 =

* Add 'id' to widget ordering options (thanks @zymeth25! 🎉)
* Add currenttags=all for AND relationship (thanks @zymeth25! 🎉)

= 0.78.1 =

* Refactor in widget parameters by @zymeth25, all widget related issues with missing parameters will be gone for good.

= 0.78 =

* Adds `before=today`, when you use it the plugin will get today's date dynamically and display only old posts. Thanks @nnasirzada for the PR implementing this!
* Changes in pagination: You can now have no anchor links in the pagination. Check [the wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Pagination) for more info. Thanks @zymeth25 for this feature! If you're using the `lcp_page_link` somewhere or customized the `lcp-paginator.php` file somehow, watch out because we refactored this function. Also, let us know what you changed to see if we can incorporate it in the core plugin :)

= 0.77.1 =

* Bug fix by @zymeth25: In some rare cases wp_reset_query fails to reset global $post to its initial value. This manual reset ensures the plugin leaves the main query in a clean state regardless of circumstances. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/your-plugin-has-a-crazy-bug-conflict-with-elementor/#post-10145793 and https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues/320.

= 0.77 =

* Improvements in testing by @zymeth25.
* Removed hardcoded wp_ as table prefix and replaced with $wpdb->prefix to allow for WordPress database tables which are setup to use more secure prefixes by @djadan.

= 0.76.1 =

* Fixes parsing error for PHP < 5.4. We will be dropping support for PHP pre 5.4 soon, so we recommend you to upgrade to a newer version.

= 0.76 =

* Do not hide empty categories from widget.
Special thanks to Klemens Starybrat (zymeth25) for all the contributions.


= 0.74.2 =

* Add pagination function for templates.

= 0.74.1 =

* Possibly fixed a bug where the code for the Paginator class would show up in some blogs. Apparently some PHP ini accept "<?" as a valid way of starting a php file, others don't.

= 0.74 =
* Adds "next" and "previous" classes to the previous and next buttons in pagination menu. The classes are `lcp_prevlink` and `lcp_nextlink`. Thanks @zymeth25.
* Adds pagination to Widget.

= 0.73.2 =

* Bug fix release: `[catlist categorypage="yes"]` had stopped working with WordPress 4.9. This is because the category check would compare a return value against the "Empty Term" translation key which was changed [in this commit](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/a42b9cebdebb2809b484f4187757555f30c9ee08#diff-efd15818123d55a117706670be80c15aR749) adding periods at the end of some error messages. So it was just a matter of adding the period in the if condition. Thanks helmutka for reporting this!

= 0.73.1 =

* Bumped version because WordPress.org wouldn't grab the previous one.

= 0.73 =

* Support "and" relationship for custom taxonomies, by [Dalton Rooney](https://github.com/daltonrooney).
* Support for multiple taxonomies in the same shortcode by [TheSquiffy](https://github.com/TheSquiffy)
* Tested up to WordPress 4.9
* Adds Irish translation by Jordan Silaen.

= 0.72 =

Several bug fixes:

* Makes sure the `tags_as_class` instance variable is defined. This squelched an 'undefined index' PHP Notice that appeared for widgets that were last saved before upgrading to 0.71.1. Fix by Matthew Eppelsheimer (@MatthewEppelsheimer on GitHub).
* Adds a new tutorial in the docs, check it out!
* Fixes a bug where customfield_value wouldn't work if a custom field's value = 0
* Adds tag/class html customization refactor to excerpt to behave as expected:
    * If you provide `excerpt_tag` but not `excerpt_class`, excerpt will be wrapped with given tag.
    * If you provide `excerpt_tag` and `excerpt_class`, excerpt will be wrapped with provided tag and given class.
    * If you provide `excerpt_class` but not `excerpt_tag`, excerpt will be wrapped with a span and the given class.
* Fixes an error notice when widget is displayed for "current category" on post without category - `Notice: Undefined offset: 0 in /include/lcp-category.php on line 69`


= 0.71.1 =

* Fixes ["Undefined index: tags_as_class"](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues/227). Thanks @vacuus for the Pull Request! :)

= 0.71 =

* Added tags_as_class: Use a post's tags as a class for the li that lists the posts. Default is no. Thanks @vacuus on GitHub for this PR!

= 0.70 =

* Fixed [customfield_class and customfield_tag issues](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues/201). Thanks [vacuus](https://github.com/vacuus)!!
* Tested up to WordPress 4.6.1
* Added date range, thanks again [vacuus](https://github.com/vacuus)!! Check [the docs](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/How-to-select-which-posts-to-show) to read how to use this.

= 0.69 =

* Update lcp-widget.php for PHP 7 compatibility. Thanks @kenshin23!

= 0.68 =

Thanks @mmatthews1981, @ottadvantage and @mhoeher for their contributions on this version:

* Adds custom css class to current page in pagination `lcp_currentpage`.
* Adds child_categories parameter to being able to exclude child categories' posts from a list.
* New feature to look for the first image in a post when requesting a thumbnail and the post has no featured image. Thanks Michael J. Gibbs for writing this code :)

= 0.66 =
* Full release notes: https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/releases/tag/0.66
* Orders the README a bit.
* Issues with tags when using more than one tag for OR and AND relationships should be fixed.
* Documented the use of custom taxonomies. For some reason I never came around to do that. I changed the parameters for taxonomies, it used the 'tags' parameter for 'terms' before, so I added a 'terms' parameter to make this independent from the tags parameter. So now it looks like this: `[catlist taxonomy='person' terms='bob']`. This might break some current uses of taxonomy, but since it was written so long ago and I don't know why it used "tags", I decided to just create the 'terms' parameter. People using the custom taxonomies were people who are looking at the code anyway since I can't find it documented anywhere. Sorry for the inconveniences!
* Adds category description parameter.
* Adds orderby and order to options page. Removes default values since they're the default anyway.

= 0.65 =

* Adds pagination parameter to the options page.
