List Category Posts allows you to list posts by category and many other parameters in a post, page or widget. You use the [catlist] shortcode to select which posts to show and how. There's tons of customizations available.

== Description ==

List Category Posts allows you to list posts by category in a post or page using the `[catlist]` shortcode. When you're editing a page or post, directly insert the shortcode in your text and the posts will be listed there. The *basic* usage would be something like this:

`[catlist id=1]`

`[catlist name="news"]`

The shortcode accepts a category name or id, the order in which you want the posts to display, and the number of posts to display. You can also display the post author, date, excerpt, custom field values, even the content! A lot of parameters have been added to customize what to display and how to show it. Check [the full documentation](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) to learn about the different ways to use it.

The `[catlist]` shortcode can be used as many times as needed with different arguments on each post/page.
`[catlist id=1 numberposts=10]`

There's an options page with only one option -for the moment-, new options will be implemented on demand (as long as they make sense). Right now the only global option is the `numberposts` parameter, to define a default number of posts to show for each instance (you can override this value by using the `numberposts` parameter in your shortcode).

**[Read the instructions](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki)** to learn which parameters are available and how to use them.

If you want to **List Categories** instead of posts you can use my other plugin **[List categories](http://wordpress.org/plugins/list-categories/)**.

You can find **Frequently Asked Questions** [here](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md#frequently-asked-questions).

**Customization**

The different elements to display can be styled with CSS. you can define an HTML tag to wrap the element with, and a CSS class for this tag. Check [the documentation](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) for usage. You can also check [this nice tutorial](http://sundari-webdesign.com/wordpress-the-quest-to-my-perfect-list-view-for-posts-events-and-articles/) which gives lots of tips and how-to's to customize how to display the posts.

Great to use WordPress as a CMS, and create pages with several categories posts.

**GUI**

Klemens Starybrat has created a GUI for List Category Posts. It helps you create a shortcode from a nice visual interface in WordPress' text editor. Check it out:
[GUI for List Category Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gui-for-lcp/)

**Widget**

Since WordPress 4.9, [you can use shortcode in text widgets](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/). So you can just add a text widget in Appearence > Widgets and write the List Category Posts shortcode.

The plugin also includes a widget as a simple interface for its functionality. Just add as many widgets as you want, and select all the available options from the Appearence > Widgets page. Not all the functionality in the shortcode has been implemented in the widget yet. You can use the shortcode for the most flexibility.

Please, read the information on [the wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) and [Changelog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/list-category-posts/#developers) to be aware of new functionality, and improvements to the plugin.

**Videos**

Some users have made videos on how to use the plugin (thank you, you are awesome!), check them out here:

 * [Manage WordPress Content with List Category Posts Plugin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBy_qoGKpdo)
 * [WordPress: How to List Category Posts on a Page](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfnzk4IWPNA)

**Support the plugin**

Klemens Starybrat has been writing lots of amazing code for this plugin, so if you've found it useful and want to pay it forward, consider sponsoring him on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/klemens-st

I have a [PayPal account](http://picandocodigo.net/programacion/wordpress/list-category-posts-wordpress-plugin-english/#support "Donate via PayPal") where you can donate too.


**Development**

Development is being tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts). Fork it, code, make a pull request, suggest improvements, etc. over there. I dream of the day all of the WordPress plugins will be hosted on Git :)

Since the documentation on how to use the plugin has passed wordpress.org's character limit, the text was cut. I've since started using [a wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki) for more comfortable reading and maintaining. Please check it out, suggestions are welcome on GitHub issues!

==Instructions on how to use the plugin==

Below you can find common shortcode use cases. You can use the shortcode while editing posts, pages, custom post types, text widgets and in all "page builder" plugins that support shortcodes.

Read the **[full documentation](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki)** to discover many more features, including:

* **advanced post selection options** (by date, search terms, custom fields, post types, custom taxonomies and more)
* **output customizations** (show each post's date, author, excerpt, thumbnail and more)
* **custom templates** of your own design, based on a simple PHP example

List 10 latest posts:

`[catlist]`

The default number of listed posts is 10, to modify it you need to specify `numberposts` parameter:

`[catlist numberposts=15]`

List posts from the "Dogs" category:

`[catlist name=Dogs]`

List posts from the category with id `2`:

`[catlist id=2]`

By default only the "post" post type is included. To list pages use:

`[catlist post_type=page]`

and for both posts and pages:

`[catlist post_type="post,page"]`

If we combine the above options we can get a shortcode that lists 15 items, including post and pages, from the "Dogs" category:

`[catlist name=Dogs post_type="post,page" numberposts=15]`

Most of the parameters you will find in the documentation can be used together.

The plugin can detect current post's category and use it for listing:

`[catlist categorypage=yes]`

Same goes for tags:

`[catlist currenttags=yes]`

To show each post's excerpt use:

`[catlist excerpt=yes]`

If you want to show the date, author and comments count next to each post, use:

`[catlist date=yes author=yes comments=yes]`

You can specify html tags and classes for many elements. Let's modify the previous shortcode and wrap dates and authors in tags and classes of our choice:

`[catlist date=yes date_tag=span date_class="my-date" author=yes author_tag=p author_class="my-author" comments=yes]`

[Read more about this feature](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/HTML-&-CSS-Customization)

You can order posts by date:

`[catlist orderby=date]`

You can also use `title`, `author`, `ID`. More options are described in the documentation.

The plugin also supports pagination. You need to specify `numberposts` to tell the plugin how many posts per page you want:

`[catlist pagination=yes numberposts=5]`

See the wiki: [Pagination](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Pagination) for more information.

Please read the **[full documentation](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki)** for detailed documentation of all plugin features, use cases and shortcode parameters.

==Installation==

* Upload the `list-category-posts` directory to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Login to your WordPress Admin menu, go to Plugins, and activate it.
* Start using the '[catlist]` shortcode in your posts and/or pages.
* You can find the List Category Posts widget in the Appearence > Widgets section on your WordPress Dashboard.
* If you want to customize the way the plugin displays the information, check [HTML & CSS Customization](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/HTML-&-CSS-Customization) or the [section on Templates](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Template-System) on the wiki.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE PLUGIN**

Check out [the Wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/)

Please read the instructions and the FAQ before opening a new topic in the support forums.

**Widget**

The widget is quite simple, and it doesn't implement all of the plugin's functionality.

Since WordPress 4.9, you can use a shortcode in a widget. If you're using a previous WordPress version, add this code to your theme's functions.php file:

`add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');`

Then just add a new text widget to your blog and use the shortcode there as the widget's content.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.66 =
Full release notes:
https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/releases/tag/0.66

= 0.65 =
Full release notes here: https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/releases/tag/0.65

= 0.37 =

When using `content=yes`, if the post has a more tag, the plugin will only show the content previous to the more tag and not all the content as it used before (it now supports the more tag the same way as WordPress).

= 0.34 =
 * Now the plugin accepts either class or tag or both for styling elements (such as date, author, etc. to display). When just using a tag, it will sorround the element with that tag. When using just a class, it will sorround the element between span tags and the given CSS class. Check [Other notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) under **HTML & CSS Customization** for more info.
 * Fixed bug on `post_status`, it used to show all published posts and if user was logged in, all private ones too. Now you can specify 'private' to just display private posts, and draft, publish, draft, etc (See **post_status** param on the [instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/other_notes/) for more info).

= 0.25 =
* Translation support.

= 0.18 =
Template system was upgraded with new options. Backwards compatible, but you can better customize the way the post contents are displayed. Check templates/default.php.

= 0.17 =
Upgrade your templates: Templates system was rewritten, so your current templates will probably not work. Check out the new default.php file on /templates to see the simpler new way to work with templates.

= 0.13.2 =
Thumbnail parameter 'thumbnails' changed to 'thumbnail.

= 0.7.2 =
Template system has changed. Now the posts loop must be defined inside the template. Check templates/default.php for an example.

= 0.8 =
Widget built for WordPress 2.8's Widget API, so you need at least WP 2.8 to use the widget.

= 0.9 =
Template system has changed. Custom templates should be stored in WordPress theme folder.

== Changelog ==

= 0.84.0 =

* **New feature**: Select specific posts by IDs: `[catlist includeposts="2,97"]`. Thanks @hvianna!
* **New feature:** Advanced customfield filtering with `customfield_compare`, see [the docs](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/How-to-select-which-posts-to-show#other-ways-of-selecting-what-posts-to-show) for instructions.
* **New feature:** It is now possible to style `category_description` with `category_description_tag` and `category_description_class`.
* Changed the default wrapper tag for `content=yes` to `<div>` to avoid generating invalid HTML (previously `<p>`).
* Fixed `excerpt_full` not being run through `the_excerpt` filters (thanks @StefanXRoos!). The filters are now applied same as for `excerpt_yes`. **Please check your setup** if you are using `excerpt_full`.
* Fixed `display_id` bug, thanks for reporting @fiestoforo!
* Fixed PHP warnings in WP admin caused by the widget, thanks for reporting @hiskingdomprophecy (#420).
* Fixed `posts_where` filter not being properly removed when using `starting_with`.
* Full refactor of HTML generation making it easier to maintain.
* Upgraded PHP to 7.4 in the Vagrant machine.

= 0.83.1 =

* Fixes bug with order parameter after refactor: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/notice-undefined-variable-params/

= 0.83 =

This is a big release since @zymeth25 and I have been doing lots of refactoring based on maintainability, code quality and testing. It means the code is much cleaner and easier to maintain. So fixing bugs or adding new features should be easier now. If you find any issues, please report them on GitHub (https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues).

* Development: We've refactored a lot of the code in `include`, updated the build, bumped versions, added tests, and more.
* Bugfix: An issue where `customfield_display_glue` was shown even when the custom field values were empty - https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hide-the-glue-content-if-costum-fields-are-empty
* Bugfix: Fixed excluded categories when using an `and` relationship.
* New parameter: `ol_offset`, when you use an ordered list, you can set an offset so the posts will start from that number instead of 1.
* *Templates system refactor* - The plugin now uses the template system by default. There should be no changes on how the plugin works, but please do let us know if you have any issues. Building templates should be easier now. You can use the included template as an example to start. It's in the plugin's template folder under the name default.php. Be warned, however, that this is the default template the plugin uses to create output so if you change it, you *will change* the plugin's default behavior. When you update the plugin this file will be overwritten so it's best not to edit it but copy it over to another file to create your custom template.

- Official docs: https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/HTML-&-CSS-Customization#templates

= 0.82 =

* Adds support for several authors. To select posts from one author, you can use the **author_posts** parameter and use 'user_nicename' (NOT name). Example: `[catlist author_posts="fernando"]`. If you want to select posts from several authors, you need to use the author id instead. You can find the id for each author in `wp-admin/users.php`. It needs to be a comma separated value, example: `[catlist author_posts="1,2"]`
* Rewrote `excludeposts` function. It wasn't working very well with `this`.

= 0.81 =

* Adds "<span class='lcp_elipsis'>" to the "..." in pagination.
* Adds 'current_user' as an option to the author_posts parameter to list posts from logged in user.

= 0.80.3 =

* Hopefully final bugfix from alt in thumbnails 🤦🏻

= 0.80.2 =

* Bugfix release: With 0.80, using the post title as alt attribute in thumbnails made a change to use `get_the_post_thumbnail_url`. But thanks to [a post in the support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/since-last-update-thumbnail-size-no-more-work-correct/), I noticed we lost some of the sizing functionality in `get_the_post_thumbnail`. So this version goes back to using get_the_post_thumbnail but keeping the new alt attribute for thumbnails.

= 0.80.1 =

* Bugfix release: fix for featured image link to full post not working. Thanks Werner!

= 0.80 =

* Use post title as alt attribute in thumbnails. Thanks @arcticmouse!
* Dynamic pagination paddin. Thanks @zymeth25! More info: https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Pagination#pagination-padding
* Bugfix current category for posts displayed in the loop. Thanks @zymeth25! More info: https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/pull/363
* Added "private" text next to a post's title when it's private, thanks to a suggestion by @cmccrone in the support forums. The text is published with the following html: `<span class="lcp_private"> private</span>`, so you can customize the CSS (hide it, change its color, etc.).

= 0.79 =

* Requires PHP >= 5.4
* `categorypage` now suppports `yes` for all post's categories with OR relationship, `all` for AND relationship and `other` to get all categories except current categories (with OR relationship) (thanks @zymeth25! 🎉)
* Possibly one of the last versions before 1.0.
* Fixes in current category (thanks @zymeth25! 🎉)
* Added link to Klemens' GUI.
* Moved documentation to the wiki: https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki
* Add 'id' to widget ordering options (thanks @zymeth25! 🎉)
* Add currenttags=all for AND relationship (thanks @zymeth25! 🎉)

= 0.78.1 =

* Refactor in widget parameters by @zymeth25, all widget related issues with missing parameters will be gone for good.

= 0.78 =

* Adds `before=today`, when you use it the plugin will get today's date dynamically and display only old posts. Thanks @nnasirzada for the PR implementing this!
* Changes in pagination: You can now have no anchor links in the pagination. Check [the wiki](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/Pagination) for more info. Thanks @zymeth25 for this feature! If you're using the `lcp_page_link` somewhere or customized the `lcp-paginator.php` file somehow, watch out because we refactored this function. Also, let us know what you changed to see if we can incorporate it in the core plugin :)

= 0.77.1 =

* Bug fix by @zymeth25: In some rare cases wp_reset_query fails to reset global $post to its initial value. This manual reset ensures the plugin leaves the main query in a clean state regardless of circumstances. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/your-plugin-has-a-crazy-bug-conflict-with-elementor/#post-10145793 and https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues/320.

= 0.77 =

* Improvements in testing by @zymeth25.
* Removed hardcoded wp_ as table prefix and replaced with $wpdb->prefix to allow for WordPress database tables which are setup to use more secure prefixes by @djadan.

= 0.76.1 =

* Fixes parsing error for PHP < 5.4. We will be dropping support for PHP pre 5.4 soon, so we recommend you to upgrade to a newer version.

= 0.76 =

* Starting_with support for utf8mb4 charset
* Improve catlink/catlist in widget
* Avoid PHP Notices when trying to replace widget title but no category is present.
* Fix 'current category' handling
* Better test coverage
* Fix dates parameters: `before` and `after` are now working again
* Remove warning for deprecated `create_function` in PHP 7

= 0.75.2 =

* Fix `author_post` and `search` parameters.
* Multiple instances pagination fix.
* New test for the LcpPaginator class.

= 0.75.1 =

* Fix a case where pagination would show up but the CSS wasn't being loaded.
* Fixes other issues with pagination
Thanks Klemens Starybrat (zymeth25) for the fixes in this release :)

= 0.75 =

* Improvements to `custom_fields` and `customfield_orderby`. Please check the readme for more information.
* Several bug fixes to pagination.
* Do not hide empty categories from widget.
Special thanks to Klemens Starybrat (zymeth25) for all the contributions.


= 0.74.2 =

* Add pagination function for templates.

= 0.74.1 =

* Possibly fixed a bug where the code for the Paginator class would show up in some blogs. Apparently some PHP ini accept "<?" as a valid way of starting a php file, others don't.

= 0.74 =
* Adds "next" and "previous" classes to the previous and next buttons in pagination menu. The classes are `lcp_prevlink` and `lcp_nextlink`. Thanks @zymeth25.
* Adds pagination to Widget.

= 0.73.2 =

* Bug fix release: `[catlist categorypage="yes"]` had stopped working with WordPress 4.9. This is because the category check would compare a return value against the "Empty Term" translation key which was changed [in this commit](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/a42b9cebdebb2809b484f4187757555f30c9ee08#diff-efd15818123d55a117706670be80c15aR749) adding periods at the end of some error messages. So it was just a matter of adding the period in the if condition. Thanks helmutka for reporting this!

= 0.73.1 =

* Bumped version because WordPress.org wouldn't grab the previous one.

= 0.73 =

* Support "and" relationship for custom taxonomies, by [Dalton Rooney](https://github.com/daltonrooney).
* Support for multiple taxonomies in the same shortcode by [TheSquiffy](https://github.com/TheSquiffy)
* Tested up to WordPress 4.9
* Adds Irish translation by Jordan Silaen.

= 0.72 =

Several bug fixes:

* Makes sure the `tags_as_class` instance variable is defined. This squelched an 'undefined index' PHP Notice that appeared for widgets that were last saved before upgrading to 0.71.1. Fix by Matthew Eppelsheimer (@MatthewEppelsheimer on GitHub).
* Adds a new tutorial in the docs, check it out!
* Fixes a bug where customfield_value wouldn't work if a custom field's value = 0
* Adds tag/class html customization refactor to excerpt to behave as expected:
    * If you provide `excerpt_tag` but not `excerpt_class`, excerpt will be wrapped with given tag.
    * If you provide `excerpt_tag` and `excerpt_class`, excerpt will be wrapped with provided tag and given class.
    * If you provide `excerpt_class` but not `excerpt_tag`, excerpt will be wrapped with a span and the given class.
* Fixes an error notice when widget is displayed for "current category" on post without category - `Notice: Undefined offset: 0 in /include/lcp-category.php on line 69`


= 0.71.1 =

* Fixes ["Undefined index: tags_as_class"](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues/227). Thanks @vacuus for the Pull Request! :)

= 0.71 =

* Added tags_as_class: Use a post's tags as a class for the li that lists the posts. Default is no. Thanks @vacuus on GitHub for this PR!

= 0.70 =

* Fixed [customfield_class and customfield_tag issues](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/issues/201). Thanks [vacuus](https://github.com/vacuus)!!
* Tested up to WordPress 4.6.1
* Added date range, thanks again [vacuus](https://github.com/vacuus)!! Check [the docs](https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/wiki/How-to-select-which-posts-to-show) to read how to use this.

= 0.69 =

* Update lcp-widget.php for PHP 7 compatibility. Thanks @kenshin23!

= 0.68 =

Thanks @mmatthews1981, @ottadvantage and @mhoeher for their contributions on this version:

* Adds Alt Tag to thumbnail
* Handle child_categories flag correctly - https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/pull/185
* Adds a default value to numberposts on plugin activation - https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/pull/193


= 0.67.1 =
* Bugfix release, this should fix the issues with Parent Categories listings.

= 0.67 =
* Adds custom css class to current page in pagination `lcp_currentpage`.
* Adds child_categories parameter to being able to exclude child categories' posts from a list.
* New feature to look for the first image in a post when requesting a thumbnail and the post has no featured image. Thanks Michael J. Gibbs for writing this code :)

= 0.66 =
* Full release notes: https://github.com/picandocodigo/List-Category-Posts/releases/tag/0.66
* Orders the README a bit.
* Issues with tags when using more than one tag for OR and AND relationships should be fixed.
* Documented the use of custom taxonomies. For some reason I never came around to do that. I changed the parameters for taxonomies, it used the 'tags' parameter for 'terms' before, so I added a 'terms' parameter to make this independent from the tags parameter. So now it looks like this: `[catlist taxonomy='person' terms='bob']`. This might break some current uses of taxonomy, but since it was written so long ago and I don't know why it used "tags", I decided to just create the 'terms' parameter. People using the custom taxonomies were people who are looking at the code anyway since I can't find it documented anywhere. Sorry for the inconveniences!
* Adds category description parameter.
* Adds orderby and order to options page. Removes default values since they're the default anyway.

= 0.65 =

* Adds pagination parameter to the options page.
* Changes the loop in the default template.
* Fixes 'morelink_class not working with templates' in the default template.
* Adds link to post wrapper for the post date. If you have a chance, please thank [bibz](https://github.com/bibz) who is doing awesome Pull Requests to this plugin and occasionally helping out on the support forums here too :)

= 0.64 =

* Fixes get_current_tags
