List Category Posts is a **[WordPress](http://wordpress.org) plugin**
that allows you to list posts from a category into a post/page using
the [catlist] shortcode. This shortcode accepts a category name or id,
the order in which you want the posts to display, and the number of
posts to display. You can use [catlist] as many times as needed with
different arguments.

Usage:
`[catlist argument1=value1 argument2=value2]`

Please visit the
[plugin's page on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/)
to find out more.

# Want to help with the development?

I'm looking for code contributors for the plugin. If you know PHP and
would like to start contributing to the plugin, let me know! I can
help you get started. Contact me
[here](http://picandocodigo.net/about/contacto/).

# Development

A Vagrantfile is provided to set up a box for WordPress development.
You need [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) installed on your
computer.

Fork the repo, clone it locally and do `vagrant up`. You'll have a
WordPress instance running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/.

Install WordPress from that URL with this information:

 * Database Name: `wordpress`
 * User Name: `wordpressuser`
 * Password: `wordpresspass`

Activate the plugin on
http://127.0.0.1:8080/wordpress/wp-admin/plugins.php.

The plugin code is linked directly on the box, so any change you make
on the code is reflected automatically on the Vagrant box's WordPress.

### Usage

`[catlist argument1=value1 argument2=value2]`
