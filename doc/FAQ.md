##<a name="no_link"></a>How can I remove the hyperlink of the title of the post?

I had never considered this at all, but user osckar shared his solution
on [the Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/removing-hyperlink):

Add this class to your css file:

```css
.no_link {
  cursor: default !important;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

And add the class to the shortcode: `title_class=no_link`.

For those who may already have a `title_class` in their code you can
simply add the following to your current `title_class` style and it will
accomplish the same thing:

```css
cursor: default !important;
pointer-events: none;
```

##<a name="thumbnail"></a>How do I display the Thumbnail next to the title?

To see the thumbnail next to the title, you can add a class to it like
this:

`[catlist id=1 thumbnail=yes thumbnail_class=lcp_thumbnail]`

Then in your theme's stylesheet add this code:

`.lcp_thumbnail{
  float: left;
}

.lcp_catlist li{
  clear: both;
}`

If you want the thumbnail to the right, just change the `float: left`
attribute to `float: right`.


##<a name="no-title"></a>How to not display the title

You have to add a CSS class to the title with the `title_class` parameter. Then edit the title_class class in your theme's CSS file. Something like this:

In the post:
`[catlist id=3 title_class=lcp_title numberposts=1]`

And in your theme's CSS:

`.lcp_title{
  display: none;
}`

##<a name="shortcode-theme"></a>How to insert the shortcode on the theme and not a post or page

You can use this code on your theme (sidebar, footer, or wherever you like):
`<?php echo do_shortcode("[catlist id=3]"); ?>`

##<a name="columns"></a> How to display lists in columns

You don't need a template for this. You can write something like this when editing your page/post (in the "Text" text-editor):

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    [catlist id=3 numberposts=5 excludeposts=this]
    </td>
    <td>
    [catlist id=3 numberposts=5 excludeposts=this offset=5]
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

The offset should equal the number of posts (`numberposts`) times the number of column - 1. So if you had a third column, the code would look like this:
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    [catlist id=3 numberposts=5 excludeposts=this]
    </td>
    <td>
    [catlist id=3 numberposts=5 excludeposts=this offset=5]
    </td>
    <td>
    [catlist id=3 numberposts=5 excludeposts=this offset=10]
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
##<a name="widget"></a>How can I use the shortcode in a Widget?

Add this code to your theme's functions.php file:
```php
add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');
```

Then just add a new text widget to your blog and use the shortcode there
as the widget's content.

##<a name="bullets"></a>How do I remove the bullets from the list?

By default the posts will be displayed inside a ul tag with the
`lcp_catlist` CSS class. So to make the bullets disappear, just add
this CSS code to your theme's stylesheet:

```css
.lcp_catlist li{
  list-style: none;
}
```

##<a name="php5"></a>Does not work on servers with PHP < 5

This is true since version 0.18. If you're still using PHP 4 on your webhost, you should consider upgrading to PHP 5. WordPress 3.1 was the last version to support PHP 4, from 3.2 and forward, only PHP 5 is supported. You can still [download an older version of the plugin](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/download/ "download an older version of the plugin") if you're using PHP 4.

##<a name="fatal-error"></a>Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error

Something like this:

```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting
T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in
/.../wp-content/plugins/list-category-posts/include/CatListDisplayer.php
on line 10*
```

It's probably due to the webhost using PHP 4. CatListDisplayer.php
declares private attributes. PHP 4 doesn't have public, private or
protected accessors. Try updating your server or using an [older version](http://wordpress.org/plugins/list-category-posts/download/).
